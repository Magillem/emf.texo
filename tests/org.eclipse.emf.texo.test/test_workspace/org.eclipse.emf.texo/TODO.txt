TODO:
- check/support modelgroup and then particurarly: multi-occurence modelgroup
http://fusesource.com/docs/framework/2.2/jaxws/JAXWSComplexTypeMappingGroup.html
- add XML Schema validation in test environment, add annotation in model to identify the xsd to use for validation
- move the fact that a model annotator is called to a type (annotation) in the model annotation, so that different model annotators can be attached to a model
- add model documentation on each generated getter/setter/member in template

- check if modelobject template can generate smaller code

- FeatureMap support:
* generate ModelFactory.createFeatureMapEntry methods
* generate feature map entry wrappers as inner classes in ModelFactory
* add method to create feature map to ModelResolver, add mapping of EStructuralFeature to entry class to ModelResolver
* generate featuremapentry class with enum
* handle featuremap and their volatile features correctly in the entity classes 

DONE:

- current model annotations do not follow the containment structure: EPackage, EClass, EFeature, change the implementation so that a ModelGen annotation has direct access to the annotations of its children, this saves computation time
